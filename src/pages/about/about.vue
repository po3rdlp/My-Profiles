      <p class="break-words whitespace-normal w-full max-w-full">
        Hi, I’m Leonard Polandos. I have a Bachelor’s degree in Informatics from
        Universitas Klabat and have been actively involved in the field of
        Information Technology.
      </p>
      <p class="break-words whitespace-normal w-full max-w-full">
        I have worked as an IT Staff at RSUD Dr. Sam Ratulangi Tondano, and have
        also taken on several freelance projects as a Web Developer for various
        companies and hospitals. I’m experienced in tasks such as server
        administration, developing hospital information systems, creating
        websites using WordPress & WooCommerce, as well as building POS systems
        and data integrations.
      </p>
      <p class="break-words whitespace-normal w-full max-w-full">
        At the hospital where I worked, I often handled the installation,
        maintenance, and monitoring of systems to ensure all devices and
        networks remained secure and running smoothly. I also frequently
        assisted users with technical issues and sometimes developed small
        applications to support daily operations.
      </p>
      <p class="break-words whitespace-normal w-full max-w-full">
        I am a dedicated, adaptable person who is always eager to learn new
        things. In addition to my technical skills, I also have strong
        communication abilities, can work on multiple tasks simultaneously, and
        am quick in analyzing problems. I’m ready to continue growing and
        contributing in a dynamic work environment.
