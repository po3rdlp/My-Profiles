        Hello! I'm Leonard Petter, commonly known as Leon. My fervent interest
        lies in the realm of software engineering, and I bring with me a month
        of experience as a Server Administrator and Project Leader at RSUD DR.
        SAMRATULANGI TONDANO. In this role, I've spearheaded the development of
        essential systems, applications, and websites for the hospital. My
        primary focus has been on honing my skills as a FrontEnd Developer, with
        a current emphasis on TypeScript, JavaScript, and Dart (currently in
        progress). Within the confines of my professional journey, I've
        successfully completed several pivotal projects for my workplace and
        have also taken on additional projects beyond my regular job
        responsibilities.
      </h1>
      <h1>
        Remaining steadfast in my commitment to professional growth, I make it a
        priority to stay updated and continually adopt best practices in the
        ever-evolving landscape of software engineering. This dedication extends
        beyond the confines of my workplace, as I actively seek and embrace
        opportunities to further expand my skill set and contribute meaningfully
        to the dynamic field of technology.
